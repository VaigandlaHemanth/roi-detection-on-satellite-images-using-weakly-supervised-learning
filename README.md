# ROI Detection on Satellite Images Using Weakly Supervised Learning

This project presents a weakly supervised learning approach for detecting regions of interest (ROI) in satellite imagery.

## Overview

The approach leverages weakly labeled data to train models for ROI detection without requiring expensive pixel-level annotations. This makes it practical for large-scale satellite image analysis.

## Features

- Weakly supervised learning framework
- ROI detection on satellite images
- Jupyter notebook implementation with detailed analysis

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow/PyTorch
- NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV
- Matplotlib for visualization

## Usage

Open and run the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook finalyear.ipynb
```

## Project Structure

- `finalyear.ipynb` - Main notebook with data processing, model training, and evaluation

## Results

See the notebook for detailed results, visualizations, and performance metrics.
